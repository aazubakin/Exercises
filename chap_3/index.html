   <h1>Minimum</h1>
   <p>Find a minimum number</p>
   <h1>Recursion</h1>
   <p>We’ve seen that % (the remainder operator) can be used to test whether a number is even or odd by using % 2 to see
      whether it’s divisible by two. Here’s another way to define whether a positive whole number is even or odd:
   <ul>
      <li>Zero is even.</li>
      <li>One is odd.</li>
      <li>For any other number N, its evenness is the same as N - 2</li>
   </ul>
   Define a recursive function isEven corresponding to this description. The function should accept a single parameter
   (a positive, whole number) and return a Boolean.

   Test it on 50 and 75. See how it behaves on -1. Why? Can you think of a way to fix this?</p>
   <h1>Bean counting</h1>
   <p>
      You can get the Nth character, or letter, from a string by writing "string"[N]. The returned value will be a
      string containing only one character (for example, "b"). The first character has position 0, which causes the last
      one to be found at position string.length - 1. In other words, a two-character string has length 2, and its
      characters have positions 0 and 1. </p>
   <p>
      Write a function countBs that takes a string as its only argument and returns a number that indicates how many
      uppercase “B” characters there are in the string.
   </p>
   <p>
      Next, write a function called countChar that behaves like countBs, except it takes a second argument that
      indicates the character that is to be counted (rather than counting only uppercase “B” characters). Rewrite
      countBs to make use of this new function.</p>
